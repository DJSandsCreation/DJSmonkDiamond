                Professor Bairstone and Dr Day, along with Ernest the dog, were on an
                expedition in Siberia when they discovered the Monk Diamond.<br />It had
                been hidden in a remote mountain cave.<br />The Bond Brothers attempted to
                sabotage the expedition and reclaim the diamond but were unsuccessful.<br />
                The team returned to Moscow with the diamond and a special exhibition is
                being held at the House of Volkov to celebrate their discovery.
